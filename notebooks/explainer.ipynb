    "We have chosen this dataset in order to investigate the patterns of fire incidents, and since London Fire Brigade in one of the largest and most busy fire departments in the globe, we figured this would be a great place to start.\n",
    "The dataset covers the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, as well as the first quarter of 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shifted to this project from our previous since we found that the data was corrupted and our preliminary analysis could not find anything worth discussing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "The Motivation for this dataset was the fact that many people die in fires every single year. One team member has even lost a relative in a fire. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",

    "The data was very clean itself. One of the things that we did not like though, was the Easting/Northing format for the locations. We are used to Latitude/longitude, and if we very to use them in D3.js, we would have to convert. \n",
    "The conversion was done using the UTM package in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also did some initial processing with the data stamps, since they for one reason used the roman numbers format for the months. Such that 1.1.2013 would be 1.I.2013 instead. This was done with a simple conversion dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can some light scripts on the data in order to answers some very basic questions like whether there was an obvious pattern in with months/day/time of day the incidents occurred. This can be seen on the site. \n",
